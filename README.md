# Redmine CAS plugin

Plugin to CASify your Redmine installation.

## Compatibility

Tested with Redmine 2.2.3 and 2.3.0, but should work fine with Redmine 2.x and possibly 1.x.
We use [CASino](http://casino.rbcas.com) as CAS server, but it should work with others as well.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository and place it in the Redmine `plugins` directory
2. Restart your webserver
3. Open Redmine and check if the plugin is visible under Administration > Plugins
4. Follow the "Configure" link and set the parameters
5. Party

## Notes

### Usage

This plugin was made for redmine installations without public areas ("Authentication required").
The default login page will still work when you access it directly (http://example.com/path-to-redmine/login).

### Single Sign Out, Single Logout

The sessions have to be stored in the database to make Single Sign Out work.
You can achieve this with a tiny plugin: [redmine_activerecord_session_store](https://github.com/pencil/redmine_activerecord_session_store)

### Auto-create users

By enabling this setting, successfully authenticated users will be automatically added into Redmine if they do not already exist. You *must* define the attribute mapping for at least firstname, lastname and mail attributes for this to work.
